## Compiler

The combination of that the book teaches the latest C features and the book being brand new means that a recently updated C compiler is required when getting hands on with exercises and challenges from the book.

Currently using the compiler gcc.exe (Rev4, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0.

Besides using a recent compiler there is also a header file `<c23-fallback.h>` provided with the code samples for the book. This is intended to be used as temporal solution while waiting for compilers to fully support the C23 standard.
