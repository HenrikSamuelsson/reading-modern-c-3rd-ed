## Compiler

The combination of that the book teaches the latest C features and the book being brand new means that a recently updated C compiler is required when getting hands on with exercises and challenges from the book.

Currently using the compiler gcc.exe (Rev4, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0.

Besides using a recent compiler there is also a header file `<c23-fallback.h>` provided with the code samples for the book. This is intended to be used as temporal solution while waiting for compilers to fully support the C23 standard.

## Exercises

There are exercises sprinkled throughout the book. These are meant to be done while reading to make you think about what is just being read.

At the time of writing I am reading a Manning early access program (MEAP) of the book labelled as version 4. The exercise numbering in this version is a bit random and confusing. Due to this the chapter number have been added to the exercise identifier in the below list. As an attempt to aid in the tracing of my exercise solutions to the corresponding sections in the book.
