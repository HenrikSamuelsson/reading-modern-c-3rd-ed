## Compiler

The combination of that the book teaches the latest C features and the book being brand new means that a recently updated C compiler is required when getting hands on with exercises and challenges from the book.

Currently using the compiler gcc.exe (Rev4, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0.

Besides using a recent compiler there is also a header file `<c23-fallback.h>` provided with the code samples for the book. This is intended to be used as temporal solution while waiting for compilers to fully support the C23 standard.

## Exercises

There are exercises sprinkled throughout the book. These are meant to be done while reading to make you think about what is just being read.

At the time of writing I am reading an Manning early access program (MEAP) version of the book, called MEAP Edition - Modern C, Third Edition, Version 4. In this edition the exercise ordering and numbering is a bit random and all over the place, making it hard to identify the exercises. Have hence here below opted for including both the page of the exercise as well as the number of the exercise as per the current book. If you have another version of the book there will unfortunately be some confusion.
