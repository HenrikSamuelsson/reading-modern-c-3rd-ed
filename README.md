## Compiler

The combination of that the book teaches the latest C features and the book being brand new means that a recently updated C compiler is required when getting hands on with exercises and challenges from the book.

Currently using the compiler gcc.exe (Rev4, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0.

Besides using a recent compiler there is also a header file `<c23-fallback.h>` provided with the code samples for the book. This is intended to be used as temporal solution while waiting for compilers to fully support the C23 standard.

## Exercises

There are exercises sprinkled throughout the book. These are meant to be done while reading to make you think about what is just being read.

The exercise numbering is a bit confusing, for example so is the first exercise found called *Exs 3* and not Exs 1 as you might expect. Have below added the chapter number to the exercise identifier, attempting to aid in the tracing of my exercise solutions to the corresponding sections in the book.
