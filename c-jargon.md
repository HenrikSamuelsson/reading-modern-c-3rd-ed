# C Jargon

C comes with its own set vocabulary used to talk about C coding. The book introduces terms from this vocabulary. These are here listed in alphabetical order with explanations.

## C

**call**  


## J

**jump**  
We do not always want all statements in the code to be executed sequentially line by line. C offers several types of constructs that allows to skip code form being executed, and instead move on directly to other parts of the code. We say that we jump, as in jumping over something. Examples are ``if``/``else``, ``break``, ``continue`` and ``goto``.

## P

**prints**  
When a C program outputs text, such as in a terminal window, we say that it prints.

## S

**statement**  
Part of a C program that forms an instruction for the machine that will execute the program. A complete program will typically contain many statements that are executed one by one.
