# C Jargon

C comes with its own set vocabulary used to talk about C coding. The book introduces terms from this vocabulary. Some of these terms are here listed in alphabetical order with explanations.

## A

**argument**  
The actual value of an parameter passed along in a function call.

## C

**call**  
A statement that starts the execution of a function.

## F

**function**  
A building block of code that runs when called from other code. Benefit being that code can be reused by defining it once and then use it many times.

## J

**jump**  
We do not always want all statements in the code to be executed sequentially line by line. C offers several types of constructs that allows to skip code form being executed, and instead move on directly to other parts of the code. We say that we jump, as in jumping over something. Examples are ``if``/``else``, ``break``, ``continue`` and ``goto``.

## P

**parentheses**  
A pair of markings in C source code that looks like: `()`. Commonly used with other code placed inside the pair. Interpretation of the parentheses depending on context. One usage being to indicate a function call.

**print**  
When a C program outputs text, commonly in a terminal window.

## S

**statement**  
Small part of a C program that forms an instruction for the machine, to be executed when the program runs.
