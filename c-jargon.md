C comes with its own set vocabulary used to talk about C coding. The book introduces terms from this vocabulary. These are here listed in alphabetical order with explanations.

## J

**jump**  - We do not always want all statements in the code to be executed sequentially line by line. C offer several types of constructs that allows to skip code form being executed and instead move on directly to other parts of the code. For example ``if``, ``break``, ``continue`` and ``goto``. We say that we jump, as in jumping over something.
